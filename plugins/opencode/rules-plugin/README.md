A lightweight OpenCode plugin that discovers and injects markdown rule files into AI agent system prompts, enabling flexible behavior customization without per-project configuration.

## Overview

opencode-rules automatically loads rule files from standard directories and integrates them into AI agent prompts, allowing you to:

- Define global coding standards that apply across all projects
- Create project-specific rules for team collaboration
- Apply conditional rules based on file patterns, prompt keywords, or available tools
- Maintain zero-configuration workflow with sensible defaults

This approach allows you to dynamically include rules automatically like style guides for specific languages,
guidance on specific actions, etc. Unlike skills, which are called on by the agent, rules use a simple matching
approach.

## Features

- **Dual-format support**: Load rules from both `.md` and `.mdc` files
- **Conditional rules**: Apply rules based on file paths, prompt keywords, or available tools
- **Keyword matching**: Apply rules when the user's prompt contains specific keywords
- **Tool-based rules**: Apply rules only when specific MCP tools are available
- **Global and project-level rules**: Define rules at both system and project scopes
- **Context-aware injection**: Rules filtered by extracted file paths and user prompts
- **Zero-configuration**: Works out of the box with XDG Base Directory specification
- **TypeScript-first**: Built with TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- **Performance optimized**: Efficient file discovery and minimal startup overhead

## Quick Start

### Installation

Add the plugin to your opoencode config:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-rules@latest"]
}
```

### Create Your First Rule

1. Create the global rules directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/rules
   ```

2. Add a simple rule file:

   ```bash
   cat > ~/.config/opencode/rules/coding-standards.md << 'EOF'
   # Coding Standards

   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Follow the project's code style guide
   - Write self-documenting code
   EOF
   ```

That's it! The rule will now be automatically injected into all AI agent prompts.

## Configuration

### Rule Discovery Locations

Rules are automatically discovered from these directories (including all subdirectories):

1. **Global rules**: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/rules/` (typically `~/.config/opencode/rules/`)
2. **Project rules**: `.opencode/rules/` (in your project root)

Both directories are scanned recursively, allowing you to organize rules into subdirectories.

### Supported File Formats

- `.md` - Standard markdown files with optional metadata
- `.mdc` - Markdown files with optional metadata

## Usage Examples

### Basic Rule File

Create `~/.config/opencode/rules/naming-convention.md`:

```markdown
# Naming Convention Rules

- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Prefix private properties with underscore
```

### Conditional Rule with Metadata

Create `~/.config/opencode/rules/typescript.mdc`:

```markdown
---
globs:
  - '**/*.ts'
  - '**/*.tsx'
---

# TypeScript Best Practices

- Always use `const` and `let`, avoid `var`
- Use interfaces for object types
- Add type annotations for function parameters
- Avoid `any` type without justification
- Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
```

This rule only applies when processing TypeScript files.

### Keyword-Based Rule

Create `~/.config/opencode/rules/testing.mdc`:

```markdown
---
keywords:
  - 'testing'
  - 'unit test'
  - 'jest'
  - 'vitest'
---

# Testing Best Practices

- Write tests before implementing features (TDD)
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high test coverage on critical paths
```

This rule applies when the user's prompt mentions testing-related terms.

### Tool-Based Rule

Create `~/.config/opencode/rules/websearch.mdc`:

```markdown
---
tools:
  - 'mcp_websearch'
  - 'mcp_codesearch'
---

# Web Search Best Practices

- Always verify search results with multiple sources
- Prefer official documentation over third-party tutorials
- Check publication dates for time-sensitive information
```

This rule only applies when the websearch or codesearch MCP tools are available.

NOTE: Due to limitations on how opencode provides tools via the SDK, individual
MCP tools cannot be matched. Only built-in tools, plugin tools, and whole MCPs
can be matched.

### Combined Globs and Keywords Rule

Create `~/.config/opencode/rules/test-files.mdc`:

```markdown
---
globs:
  - '**/*.test.ts'
  - '**/*.spec.ts'
keywords:
  - 'testing'
---

# Test File Standards

- Use `describe` blocks to group related tests
- Use `it` or `test` with clear descriptions
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
```

This rule applies when EITHER a test file is in context OR the user mentions testing (OR logic).

### Combined Tools with Other Conditions

Create `~/.config/opencode/rules/lsp-typescript.mdc`:

```markdown
---
tools:
  - 'mcp_lsp'
globs:
  - '**/*.ts'
keywords:
  - 'type checking'
---

# LSP-Enabled TypeScript Development

- Use LSP hover to check inferred types
- Navigate to definitions using goToDefinition
- Find all references before refactoring
```

This rule applies when the LSP tool is available OR TypeScript files are in context OR the user mentions type checking.

### Organized Rules with Subdirectories

You can organize rules into subdirectories for better management. Rules are discovered recursively from all subdirectories:

```
~/.config/opencode/rules/
├── coding-standards.md        # Always applied
├── typescript/
│   ├── general.md             # TypeScript general rules
│   └── react.mdc              # React-specific rules (conditional)
├── testing/
│   └── vitest.md              # Testing guidelines
└── security/
    └── api-keys.md            # Security rules
```

Hidden directories (starting with `.`) are automatically excluded from discovery.

### Project-Specific Rules

Create `.opencode/rules/react-components.mdc` in your project:

```markdown
---
globs:
  - 'src/components/**/*.tsx'
---

# React Component Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Export components as named exports
- Include PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Co-locate styles with components
```

## Metadata Format

Both `.md` and `.mdc` files support optional YAML metadata for conditional rule application:

```yaml
---
globs:
  - 'src/**/*.ts'
  - 'lib/**/*.js'
keywords:
  - 'refactoring'
  - 'cleanup'
tools:
  - 'mcp_websearch'
  - 'mcp_lsp'
---
```

### Supported Fields

- `globs` (optional): Array of glob patterns for file-based matching
  - Rule applies when any file in context matches a pattern
- `keywords` (optional): Array of keywords for prompt-based matching
  - Rule applies when the user's prompt contains any keyword
  - Case-insensitive matching
  - **Wildcard support**: Use `*` for flexible matching (e.g., `开发*技能` matches "开发一个技能")
  - **English keywords**: Word-boundary matching (e.g., "test" matches "testing", NOT "contest")
  - **Chinese/CJK keywords**: Substring matching by default (no word boundaries in CJK)
  - **Mixed language**: Boundary behavior determined by first character
- `tools` (optional): Array of tool IDs for tool-availability matching
  - Rule applies when any listed tool is available to the agent
  - Uses exact string matching against tool IDs (e.g., `mcp_websearch`, `mcp_bash`)
  - Enable debug logging (`OPENCODE_RULES_DEBUG=1`) to see available tool IDs

### Matching Behavior

- **No metadata**: Rule applies unconditionally (always included)
- **Only globs**: Rule applies when any context file matches
- **Only keywords**: Rule applies when the user's prompt contains any keyword
- **Only tools**: Rule applies when any listed tool is available
- **Multiple conditions**: Rule applies when ANY condition matches (OR logic across all fields)

### Keyword Matching Details

The keyword matching system supports both English and CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) languages:

| Keyword Pattern | Matches | Does NOT Match |
|-----------------|---------|----------------|
| `test` (English) | "testing", "test code" | "contest", "attest" |
| `开发技能` (Chinese) | "帮我开发技能吧", "开发技能" | - (substring match) |
| `开发*技能` (wildcard) | "开发一个技能", "开发游戏技能" | - |
| `*deploy*` (wildcard) | "autodeploy", "deploying" | - |
| `app部署` (mixed, English first) | "start app部署" | "testapp部署" |
| `部署app` (mixed, Chinese first) | "自动部署app", "部署app" | - |

## Glob Pattern Reference

The plugin uses `minimatch` for pattern matching:

| Pattern                       | Matches                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `src/**/*.ts`                 | All TypeScript files in src and subdirectories  |
| `**/*.test.ts`                | All test files at any depth                     |
| `src/components/**/*.tsx`     | React components in components directory        |
| `*.json`                      | JSON files in root directory only               |
| `lib/{utils,helpers}/**/*.js` | JavaScript files in specific lib subdirectories |

## Included Skill: crafting-rules

This repository includes a `crafting-rules/` skill that teaches AI agents how to create well-formatted rules. The skill provides:

- **Rule format reference** - Frontmatter fields (`globs`, `keywords`, `tools`) and markdown body structure
- **Matching strategy guidance** - When to use globs vs keywords vs tools vs combinations
- **Pattern extraction workflow** - How to identify repeated conversation patterns that should become rules
- **Keyword safety guidelines** - Denylist of overly broad keywords to avoid, allowlist of safe alternatives, and an audit checklist

To use the skill, copy `skills/crafting-rules/` to `~/.config/opencode/skills/` or reference it directly. The skill triggers when users ask to create rules, codify preferences, or persist guidance across sessions.

- **@opencode-ai/plugin** - OpenCode plugin framework
- **Vitest** - Fast unit testing
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **ESLint** - Linting and code quality

## Architecture

This plugin uses OpenCode's hook system for incremental, stateful rule injection:

### Hook-Based Approach

1. **`tool.execute.before`** - Authoritative path capture from tool execution
   - Fires before each tool runs (read, edit, write, glob, grep, etc.)
   - Captures `filePath` or `path` arguments authoritative from the tool definition
   - Updates session state with normalized, verified context paths
   - Provides real-time context as tools are executed

2. **`chat.message`** - Incremental user prompt capture
   - Fires as each user message arrives
   - Extracts and stores the latest user prompt text
   - Enables keyword-based rule matching across the conversation flow

3. **`experimental.chat.messages.transform`** - One-time seeding fallback
   - Fires before the first LLM call only (skipped on subsequent turns)
   - Seeds session state from full message history if needed
   - Provides fallback context extraction from all visible messages
   - Ensures rules apply even if initial context wasn't captured by tool hooks

4. **`experimental.chat.system.transform`** - Rule injection and filtering
   - Fires before each LLM system prompt is constructed
   - Reads discovered rule files and filters based on:
     - Extracted file paths from session state
     - Latest user prompt (keyword matching)
     - Available tool IDs
   - Appends formatted rules to the system prompt

5. **`experimental.session.compacting`** - Compaction context preservation
   - Fires when a session is compacted (summarized)
   - Injects current context paths into the compaction context
   - Prevents rules from being lost during session compression

### Benefits Over Previous Approach

- **Incremental state tracking** - Builds context incrementally rather than rescanning messages each turn
- **Authoritative path capture** - Tool hooks provide verified file paths directly from the tool definition
- **Real-time responsiveness** - Context updates as tools execute and messages arrive
- **Compaction-aware** - Context persists through session compression
- **Efficient caching** - Rule discovery happens once at startup, not on every LLM call

### Experimental API Notice

This plugin depends on experimental OpenCode APIs:

- `experimental.chat.messages.transform` (fallback seeding)
- `experimental.chat.system.transform` (rule injection)
- `experimental.session.compacting` (compaction context)

These APIs may change in future OpenCode versions. Check OpenCode release notes when upgrading.

## How It Works

1. **Discovery**: Scan global and project directories for `.md` and `.mdc` files (at plugin init)
2. **Parsing**: Extract metadata from files with YAML front matter
3. **Tool Execution**: `tool.execute.before` hook captures file paths before tools run
4. **Message Flow**: `chat.message` hook updates user prompt as messages arrive
5. **Initial Seeding**: `experimental.chat.messages.transform` extracts context from message history once
6. **Rule Filtering**: `experimental.chat.system.transform` evaluates rules based on context and injects into system prompt
7. **Compaction Persistence**: `experimental.session.compacting` preserves context during session compression

## Performance

- Rule discovery performed once at plugin initialization
- Rule content cached with mtime-based invalidation for fast re-reads
- Incremental session state tracking (set of paths, not message rescanning)
- Per-session state pruned after 100 concurrent sessions to prevent memory growth
- Efficient glob matching with `minimatch`
- Tool-based path capture is non-blocking with minimal overhead
- Session context cleaned up when exceeded (LRU eviction)
- Minimal memory footprint with efficient state management

## Debug Logging

To enable debug logging, set the `OPENCODE_RULES_DEBUG` environment variable:

```bash
OPENCODE_RULES_DEBUG=1 opencode
```

This will log information about:

- Rule discovery (files found)
- Cache hits/misses
- Rule filtering (which rules are included/skipped)
- Available tool IDs (useful for writing `tools` conditions)

## Troubleshooting

### Rules Not Appearing

1. Verify directories exist: `~/.config/opencode/rules/` and/or `.opencode/rules/`
2. Check file extensions are `.md` or `.mdc`
3. Ensure files with metadata have properly formatted YAML
4. Test glob patterns using the `fileMatchesGlobs()` function

### Common Issues

- **Missing directories**: Plugin gracefully handles missing directories
- **Invalid YAML**: Metadata parsing errors are logged but don't crash the plugin
- **Pattern mismatches**: Use relative paths from project root for glob patterns
