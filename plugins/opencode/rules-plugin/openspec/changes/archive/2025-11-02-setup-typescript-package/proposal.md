## Why
Set up the repository as a basic TypeScript package called "opencode-rules" with proper build tooling and dependencies for OpenCode integration.

## What Changes
- Initialize package.json with TypeScript configuration
- Add @opencode-ai/sdk and @opencode-ai/plugin dependencies
- Set up TypeScript compiler configuration
- Create basic project structure (src/, dist/, etc.)
- Add build and development scripts
- Configure proper exports for the package
- Set up Prettier for code formatting
- Configure Vitest for unit testing

## Impact
- Affected specs: package-setup (new capability)
- Affected code: Root package.json, tsconfig.json, and basic source structure
- This establishes the foundation for all future development
