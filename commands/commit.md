description: Create a new commit for uncommitted changes
---

Create a new commit for all of our uncommitted changes.

Run `git status && git diff HEAD && git status --porcelain` to see what files are uncommitted, then add the untracked and changed files.

Add an atomic commit message with an appropriate message.

Add a tag such as "feat", "fix", "docs", etc. that reflects our work.
